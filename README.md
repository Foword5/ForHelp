# Forhelp
## A college project, a forum for students to get help on any subject
#### 2021-2022, IUT de Vélizy 78 - France

Coded mostly in PHP, in a group of 6, in wich I was the project director and lead developer.

This was the main project of my second year in the IUT of Vélizy. This is a website similar to reddit where students can ask or answer question on any subject, gain point for giving good answers and fully edit their profile. The admin side of the project was never made.
